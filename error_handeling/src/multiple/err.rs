/*
Multiple error types
The previous examples have always been very convenient; Results interact with other Results and Options interact with other Options.

Sometimes an Option needs to interact with a Result, or a Result<T, Error1> needs to interact with a Result<T, Error2>. In those cases, we want to manage our different error types in a way that makes them composable and easy to interact with.

In the following code, two instances of unwrap generate different error types. Vec::first returns an Option, while parse::<i32> returns a Result<i32, ParseIntError>:

*/

fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> i32 {
    let first = vec.first().unwrap(); // Generate error 1
    2 * first.parse::<i32>().unwrap() // Generate error 2
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec!["42", "93", "18"];
    let empty = vec![];
    let strings = vec!["tofu", "93", "18"];

    println!("The first doubled is {}", double_first(numbers));

    println!("The first doubled is {}", double_first(empty));
    // Error 1: the input vector is empty

    println!("The first doubled is {}", double_first(strings));
    // Error 2: the element doesn't parse to a number
}


/*

.Pulling Results out of Options
The most basic way of handling mixed error types is to just embed them in each other.

fn double_first(vec: Vec<&str>) -> Option<Result<i32, ParseIntError>> {

    // Error 1: the input vector is empty

    // Error 2: the element doesn't parse to a number

/*
Defining an error type
Sometimes it simplifies the code to mask all of the different errors with a single type of error. We'll show this with a custom error.

Rust allows us to define our own error types. In general, a "good" error type:

Represents different errors with the same type
Presents nice error messages to the user
Is easy to compare with other types
Good: Err(EmptyVec)
Bad: Err("Please use a vector with at least one element".to_owned())
Can hold information about the error
Good: Err(BadChar(c, position))
Bad: Err("+ cannot be used here".to_owned())
Composes well with other errors

Boxing errors
A way to write simple code while preserving the original errors is to Box them. The drawback is that the underlying error type is only known at runtime and not statically determined.

The stdlib helps in boxing our errors by having Box implement conversion from any type that implements the Error trait into the trait object Box<Error>, via From.
